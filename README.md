# P2P File Sharing System

## Prerequites
Before compiling this Maven project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system.

* Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 20.0+
* IntelliJ IDEA (optional): This project was created in IntelliJ, therefore, some features might require its use.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
2. Open IntelliJ IDEA
3. Click on 'File -> Open' in IntelliJ IDEA
4. Navigate to the project's root directory 'BitTorrent' and select it.
5. IntelliJ IDEA should automatically recognize it as a Maven project and open it.

**Note: The use of Maven is REQUIRED for proper compilation/functionality since many of the methods require 
input files located in the Maven folder 'resources' within './BitTorrent/main/resources'. If this directory is not present, unwanted behavior might occur.
Similarly, this is the location of all input files used in the project so make sure to populate this directory with ANY input file used (Common.cfg/PeerInfo.cfg)!**

### Building the Project
IntelliJ IDEA offers a convenient way to build the project, ensuring that no compilation errors are present in any file.
Within the IDEA, find the 'Build' section (hammer icon [Ctrl + F9] hotkey on Windows) and simply select 'Build Project'.
